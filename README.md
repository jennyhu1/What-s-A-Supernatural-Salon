This is for the CS325 Final Project

The bare-bones of this project is reduced to 1-2 days of "working", with some different monsters and minigames
(I am terrified of overscoping it's already happened to me twice with the game jams).
If we complete the game and it's playable, we can focus on stretch goals next. For now, don't worry about them.

To keep things simple we won't be using the Projects or Issues tab, unless you like its organization and want it for this project. I'll add it then
When you work on the code and project, use a separate branch dedicated to your changes, and even make more branches to make sure all you changes work together.
After checking over conflicts, we'll handle merge conflicts to main.

We got this y'all.
